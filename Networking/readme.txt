Well, this project is in C# but i've heard that we're using the a .dll for
 the MUD Engine, and thats what I'll be coding. So I was wondering: I'm
 most experienced with C++ and actually would have to go look for it if I
 did C#, maybe I could simply code the dll in C++. You see, it doesnt matter
 what the dll is coded in, when you link it you can link it to whatever
 language. I actually already have a Socket class made in C++ making it even
 EASIER for me. So for now I have the C++ Socket header here but I will look
 and work on coding it in C#.
