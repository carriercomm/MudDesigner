Introduction
========================================
Thank you for downloading the source code to my product Mud Designer. 
Included you will find the complete source code for the project, along
with a couple of documents pertaining to the development roadmap of the
project.

What's included
========================================
Included in this download is several things, including the source code
to the project, development roadmap file and the projects design document.
Not all of these files are completed files and are subject to change over
the next few weeks.

The Mud Designer Source is included within the "Mud Designer" directory,
however the designer is not being worked on at the moment due to a hefty
chunk of the engine being re-wrote.
The source code can be modified by loading the MudDesigner.sln file found
in the root directory of the source code.
You will need Microsofts Visual C# 2010 Express. The Source Code requires
Microsofts .NET Framework 4.0 to compile correctly.

The File "Mud Designer.pod" is the project roadmap, and can be viewed by
opening the file within the free OpenProject software found at 
http://openproj.org/openproj. This file is not yet completed.

The file "Design Document.pdf" is the design document associated with this
project. This file is not yet completed.
